PROJECT BACKGROUND

Web applications today are frequently targeted by cyberattacks, exploiting known and 
unknown vulnerabilities in the software stack. Organizations need to ensure that their 
web applications are secure and resistant to these threats. Vulnerability scanners are 
critical tools that automate the process of identifying security flaws in web 
applications, allowing developers and security professionals to mitigate risks before 
they are exploited by malicious actors.
However, many existing vulnerability scanners are either too complex for everyday 
use or require significant manual configurations. Additionally, most solutions are webbased, limiting customization and control. A desktop-based web vulnerability scanner
offers a user-friendly, readily accessible solution that can be customized to the user’s 
specific needs, especially for small to medium-sized organizations or individual 
developers.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

As more companies and people use the internet, more websites, applications, servers 
and so on are made and more data are stored in the cloud. The current world 
pandemic has seen a large increase in attacks on such servers, and there aren’t 
always enough people to check on these sites. One needs to keep up with updates, 
monitor networks and so on. Therefore, one could always use more apps to check the 
security of these sites to make sure they are updated and not exposed to any such 
vulnerabilities.

SOLUTION

The development of this scanner is considered a highly useful tool for vulnerability 
assessment, significantly reducing the time required compared to manual scanning 
methods. When reflecting on the entire project, it becomes evident that this project 
”CyberSpace - Web Vulnerability Scanner” aligns closely with the expanding usage of the internet 
and online threats. In retrospect, the goal of the web vulnerability scanner is to 
successfully achieve our goals set forth in the thesis. The primary objective was to 
develop a user friendly web vulnerability scanner capable of detecting common cyber 
threats.
